# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

This repository was cloned from:
https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.git


The code was changed in order to refactor it and fix the following issues:
-"Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
-Negative entered uality in an item remains the same while it should be 0

The code was also optimised by reducing its complexity (exit the loop asap)

Use private function to avoid code repetition.

Add comments to make it clear for future developers :)
